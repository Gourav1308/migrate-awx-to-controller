== Fill in the credentials

The export process is creating files for all the credentials that match the exportation filters, but these generated files are not fully populated, so they must be populated manually:

.Just after the export process
[.console-input]
[source,console]
----
$ cat configs/controller/AWX-ORG/credentials/2_AWX-Machine\ Credential.yaml 
---
controller_credentials:
  - name: "AWX-Machine Credential"
    description: ""
    credential_type: "Machine"
    organization: "AWX-ORG"
    inputs:
      password: ''
      username: admin

...
----

NOTE: Any text editor can be used to fill in the credentials.

.Once filled in the credentials
[.console-input]
[source,console]
----
$ cat configs/controller/AWX-ORG/credentials/2_AWX-Machine\ Credential.yaml
---
controller_credentials:
  - name: "AWX-Machine Credential"
    description: ""
    credential_type: "Machine"
    organization: "AWX-ORG"
    inputs:
      password: "{{ vaulted_machine_password }}"
      username: "{{ vaulted_machine_username }}"

...
----

As can be seen, the proposal here is to use some variables, that will be defined into a separare vaulted yaml file, so no credentials in plain text will be uploaded to the git repository:

[.console-input]
[source,console]
----
cat > my_vars/vaulted-credentials.yaml <<EOF
---
vaulted_machine_username: admin
vaulted_machine_password: verysecretpassword
...
EOF

ansible-vault encrypt --vault-password-file .vault-password my_vars/vaulted-credentials.yaml 
----

[NOTE]
====
The password provided in the the file above is not important as it won't be used to run any Job Template against any server. It's just to show the process of filling the sensitive information.
