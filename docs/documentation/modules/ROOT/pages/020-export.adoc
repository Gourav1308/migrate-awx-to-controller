[#Export]
== Export all the variables to be used in the next steps

The following variables will be used in the next steps, and are exported using `read` to avoid having sensitive information in the command history of the server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These variables are undefined when you close your terminal session, so they need to be populated each time you open a new terminal.

The shell that is expected to be used to run the snippet below is `bash`.
====

[.console-input]
[source,console]
----
read -e -p ">>> GitHub Username: " GITHUB_USERNAME
read -e -p ">>> AWX Admin User Name: " AWX_USERNAME
read -e -p ">>> AWX Admin Password: " -s AWX_PASSWORD
read -e -p ">>> AWX Hostname: " AWX_HOSTNAME
read -e -p ">>> Validate Certs (yes/no): " -i no AWX_VALIDATE_CERTS
read -e -p ">>> Is AAP (yes/no): " -i no IS_AAP
read -e -p ">>> Have Constructed Inventories (yes/no): " -i no HAVE_CONSTRUCTED
read -e -p ">>> Vault Password: " -s VAULT_PASSWORD
----

== Fork and clone the GitHub repository

The first step is to fork the Git repository https://github.com/automationiberia/migrate-awx-to-controller/ and clone it to start working. The GitHub `<GITHUB_USERNAME>` variable will be used in the commands below as it's been populated with your own username in the previous step:

====
.Fork the repository
image::github_fork_1.png[]
====
====
.Give it a name into your `<GITHUB_USERNAME>` organization
image::github_fork_2.png[]
====
====
.Wait for the fork process to finish
image::github_fork_3.png[]
====
====
.Check the repo has been successfully forked
image::github_fork_4.png[]
====

Clone the repository:
[.console-input]
[source,console]
----
mkdir ~/workdir && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/migrate-awx-to-controller
cd migrate-awx-to-controller
mkdir my_vars
----

Now, the steps below can succeed.

== Customize the AWX connection

The next step is to configure the files to let the playbooks to connect to the AWX instance:

[.console-input]
[source,console]
----
cat > my_vars/vault-awx.yaml <<EOF
---
# AWX
vault_controller_username: "${AWX_USERNAME}"
vault_controller_password: "${AWX_PASSWORD}"
vault_controller_hostname: "${AWX_HOSTNAME}"
vault_controller_validate_certs: ${AWX_VALIDATE_CERTS}
is_aap: ${IS_AAP}
have_constructed: ${HAVE_CONSTRUCTED}
...
EOF
----

As this file is containing sensitive information, it needs to be encrypted using `ansible-vault`:

[.vault-file-creation]
[.console-input]
[source,console]
----
echo ${VAULT_PASSWORD} > .vault-password
chmod 0600 .vault-password
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-password-file .vault-password my_vars/vault-awx.yaml
----

== Run the exportation process

[.console-input]
[source,console]
----
\
ansible-navigator run playbooks/config-controller-export.yaml \
  -i localhost, \
  -m stdout \
  --eei quay.io/automationiberia/casc/ee-casc:summit24 \
  --eev /tmp/:/tmp/ \
  -e @my_vars/vault-awx.yaml \
  --vault-password-file .vault-password \
  -e '{
        ansible_async_dir: /home/runner/.ansible_async/, 
        output_path: /tmp/filetree_output,
        organization_filter: AWX-ORG
      }'
